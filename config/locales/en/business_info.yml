    p2header: "2) How did my facility get on this list?"
    p2: "Someone used your restroom and wanted to submit your location as a resource. All our data is crowd-sourced and user-submitted."
    p3header: "3) How can I be a good host?"
    p3: "Thanks for asking! Often, REFUGE visitors just hope to make a quick stop and be on our way, and like any other visitor, potentially support your business or location while we're there. Friendly staff and good experiences can go a long way in getting some love for your location in the reviews section of the app (more on that below!)"
    p4header: "4) Why are safe restrooms an issue?"
    p4:
      first: "Using the restroom is an everyday activity that can be difficult for members of our community to navigate -- especially when visiting areas outside of their daily routines. That's where our mapping project comes in."
      second: "According to the <a href='http://www.ustranssurvey.org/'>US Trans Survey</a>:"
      list1: "59% of respondents avoided using a restroom for fear of confrontation"
      list2: "31% avoided eating or drinking while out, to avoid having to use the restroom"
      list3: "24% had their presence in the restroom questioned"
      list4: "12% had been harassed, attacked, or sexually assaulted in a restroom"
      list5: "9% had been denied restroom access"
      list6: "8% had developed a kidney issue or urinary tract infection from avoiding bathroom usage"
    p5header: "5) What does a review mean?"
    p5: "Reviews help visitors share experiences with each other about the location. We encourage visitors to share as much information as we have about each location on the map."
    p6header: "6) How do I remove my listing?"
    p6: "We hope you'll consider keeping your listing; it can mean a lot for people's health and wellbeing. However, if you'd rather not be listed, use our contact form to request a removal and our volunteers will work on it as soon as we can (this is an open source project so all work is done by volunteers)."
