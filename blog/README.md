# Set up the Blog
In the repository settings, navigate to GitHub pages. Select a branch to build the website from, a theme if desired, and a custom domain if desired. Save the settings.

# How to Create a Blog Post
Go to the _posts/ directory and create a new file with the format: YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md
<br>
Post titles must be in this format to work correctly!


Format the contents of the post like so:

<code>
    ---
</code>
    <br>
    layout: post
    <br>
    title: title of your blog post
    <br>
<code>
    ---
</code>
<br>
Then, simply write your post here, using any desired formatting.
