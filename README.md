# REFUGE restrooms

Providing safe restroom access to transgender, intersex, and gender nonconforming individuals.

REFUGE is an effort to fill the void left by the now-defunct Safe2Pee website. It provides a free resource to trans\* and queer individuals in need of gender neutral and other safe restrooms.

This project is open source. Feel free to contribute. We could use the help.
